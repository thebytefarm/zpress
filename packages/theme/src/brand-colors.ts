/**
 * Single source of truth for brand color hex values per built-in theme.

 * Used by:
 *  - CLI TUI banner (`packages/cli/src/components/banner.tsx`)
 *  - SVG banner / logo generator (`packages/core/src/banner/svg-shared.ts`)
 *  - Static asset generators / scripts
 *
 * Runtime CSS still owns its own variables in
 * `packages/ui/src/theme/styles/themes/*.css` and the matching FOUC
 * critical CSS — keep the hex values in sync with the ones below.
 *
 * The hex literals themselves live as a private constant inside
 * `theme-registry.ts` (`BRAND_PALETTES`) so the built-in themes can use them
 * when building their `colors.brand` token groups. This module exposes the
 * same data — derived from `BUILT_IN_THEMES` — under the historical
 * `BRAND_COLORS` / `resolveBrandPalette` names for back-compat.
